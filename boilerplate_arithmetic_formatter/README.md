# Arithmetic Formatter

This is the first of the five projects I completed to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter.git.

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter.
The same instructions are reported in the file `arithmetic_arranger.py`.

**Summary of the project:**

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve.

The project instructions asks to create a **function** that receives a **list of strings** that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

The function should optionally take a **second argument**. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers should be displayed.
