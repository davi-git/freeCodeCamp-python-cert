# freeCodeCamp Certification - "Scientific Computing with Python"

This repository contains the five problems I had to solve to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

Each of the five folder is a python project containing:
- a file with the name of the project: this is the file where I've implemented my personal solution to the problem;
- a "test_module" file: contains a set of test to validate the solution implemented;
- a "main" file: it's the file to launch to execute the tests present in the test_module.

In each folder is present a README.md containing a link with the detailed instructions for the respective project and a link to reach the original projects I worked on.
