# Time Calculator

This is the second of the five projects I completed to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-time-calculator.git.

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator.
The same instructions are reported in the file `time_calculator.py`.

**Summary of the project:**

The project instructions asks to write a **function** named `add_time` that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

- a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
- a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
- (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive

The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.
