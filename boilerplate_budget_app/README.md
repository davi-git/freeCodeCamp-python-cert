# Budget App

This is the third of the five projects I completed to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-budget-app.git.

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app.
The same instructions are reported in the file `budget.py`.

**Summary of the project:**

In this project is asked to complete a **class** with many methods. The class should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories and to manage every category making possible deposits, withdraws, transfers to other categories, always checking if an operation is possible (getting the current balance and the available funds).     

It's also asked to create a **function** that prints a string that is a bar chart to represent the percentage spent in each category passed in to the function.
