# Polygon Area Calculator

This is the fourth of the five projects I completed to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-polygon-area-calculator.git.

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/polygon-area-calculator.
The same instructions are reported in the file `shape_calculator.py`.

**Summary of the project:**

This project asks to make use of the ***inheritance*** property made available by Object Oriented Programming.
It asks to create a Rectangle class and a Circle class that is a subclass of Rectangle and inherit its methods and attributes.
