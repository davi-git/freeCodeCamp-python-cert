# Probability Calculator

This is the last of the five projects I completed to achieve the "Scientific Computing with Python" Certification on freeCodeCamp.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-probability-calculator.git.

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/probability-calculator.
The same instructions are reported in the file `prob_calculator.py`.

**Summary of the project:**

In this project you are asked to calculate the probability of getting a specific group of balls, extracting N balls from a given hat and repeating the experiment M times.

To do it, will have to be implemented a **class**, that represent the hat containing the balls to draw, and a **function**, that will be called to do experiments.
